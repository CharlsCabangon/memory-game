# Catch ‘Em Once

---

_Gotta remember 'em all... [Play the game  → ](https://charlscabangon.github.io/memory-game/)_

---

A memory game that's deceptively SIMPLE: don't click the same Pokémon twice. Cards shuffle after every click, difficulty scales, and your brain slowly realizes it's not as sharp as you thought. Pokémon data courtesy of [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co).
